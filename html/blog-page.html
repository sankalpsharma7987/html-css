                    This is my First Blog. I don't remember of writing anything ever but, as a kid, I remember of journaling my thoughts.
                    This made me streamline my thoughts and develop a habit to write whatever that came to my mind. Moving to the college, I thought of starting my own blog. But then life happened
                    and I thought of not pursuing with my blog as I got too busy with my work and had to move abroad for my higher studies.

                    Hi. My name is Sankalp and I do Software Development for living and love to meditate, read and cook.

                    So coming back to my idea of my own blog started after listening to the Habit Coach Podcast, by Ashdin Doctor.
                    (I would definitely encourage you guys to listen to that podcast, if you haven't.)

                    So while listening to that podcast, Ashdin had been mentioning about journaling your thoughts to get more clarity about your life goals and vision and I thought
                    it is a good idea to think about something which I always wanted to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I researched on couple of sites to understand the process of buying a domain and other logistics to setup a website.
                    After everything was done, I then went ahead to think about my blog name. I had couple of names in my mind but I was looking for something more catchy.
                    Once while meditating(and this is why I would encourage readers to learn about mindfullness and meditation) I thought of having a happy space where people can share
                    things they are happy about and what excites them every morning to look forward to their day.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I couldn't think of any better name than Happy Space. So here it is.. My Happy Space that I can finally call of my own.
                    The reason why I say this is because I have been leaving in rent apartments, since 2010, and have been missing my house in Mumbai, but then with this blog it is a place
                    which is my own and I can give myself time to journal my ideas and thoughts and present in front of you readers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the end of every article, I will be sharing to you what I think readers should be doing after going through my blog post for that day.
                    So for today, I would encourage readers to think about their Happy Space. It could be anything, but it should be something where you gather your thoughts
                    and encourage yourself to turn your ideas into goals and passionately chase them.

                    One of my friend once said of his Happy Space being his restroom as he gets all his ideas and things to-do, for that day, during his me time. I would not encourage
                    readers to have that kind of a Happy Space, but would rather ask readers to think about a Happy Space which you think, when you are makes you improve your quality of life.

                    So your food for thought for today, is to find your Happy Space and mention it in the comment section. I am excited to start this journey and I look forward to read your comments.
                </p>
